# Project 3: Spots

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief on Figma.

**Project Features**

This project is made so all elements are adaptive and display correctly on popular screen sizes. Excess text is truncated, ending with ellipses. Grids are used to responsively position cards containing mixed media.
