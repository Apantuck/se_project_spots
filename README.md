# Project 3: Spots

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Project Features**

This project is made so all elements are adaptive and display correctly on popular screen sizes. Excess text is truncated, ending with ellipses. Grids are used to responsively position cards containing mixed media.
